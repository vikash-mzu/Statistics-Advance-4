    "Q1: Difference between a t-test and a z-test?\n",
    "•\tT-test: Used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small (n < 30). It is based on the t-distribution.\n",
    "o\tExample: Comparing the average height of 20 people to the national average when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "•\tZ-test: Used when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large (n ≥ 30). It is based on the z-distribution (normal distribution).\n",
